#Gene-expression model
Gene expression is the process where a gene DNA information is used to create a functional product ,usually a protein or functional RNA molecule,involving steps like transcription9(DNA to RNA)
and translation(RNA to protein),allowing cells to control when,where,and how much of these products are made for normal function,development and response to the environment.
