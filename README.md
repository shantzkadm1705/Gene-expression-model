# Gene-expression-model
This repository contains a gene expression prediction model designed to analyze and predict gene expression levels based on genomic, transcriptomic, or epigenomic data. The model integrates advanced machine learning techniques to identify patterns in gene regulation and provide insights into biological processes.
Features
Data preprocessing: Handles raw genomic or transcriptomic datasets, including normalization and feature extraction.
Predictive modeling: Supports supervised learning approaches (e.g., regression, neural networks) to predict gene expression levels.
Interpretability: Provides feature importance analysis to understand which genetic or epigenetic factors drive expression patterns.
Visualization: Includes tools for plotting gene expression distributions, correlations, and model predictions.
